# [ Question ]
# In second year computer engineering class, group A studentâ€™s play cricket, group B
# students play badminton and group C students play football.
# Write a Python program using functions to compute following: -
# a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton
# b) List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both
# c) Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton
# d) Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton
# (Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, Do not use SET
# built-in functions)


# [ Code ]

# logic
# a) intersection
# b) union - intersection
# c) union
# d) intersection - B

# functions
## remove duplicates
