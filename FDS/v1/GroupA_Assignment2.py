Assignment No. 2 : Write a python program for MAGIC SQUARE.
                   A magic square is an n*n matrix of the integers 1 to (n^2) such that the sum of each row,
                   column and diagonals the same.
                   The figure given below is an example of the magic square for case n=5. In this example
                   the common sum is 65.

                   9  |   3  |  22  |  16  |  15  |
                   2  |  21  |  20  |  14  |   8  |
                  25  |  19  |  13  |   7  |   1  |
                  18  |  12  |   6  |   5  |  24  |
                  11  |  10  |   4  |  23  |  17  |

Conditions for placing the values in the matrix in appropriate manner (CIRCULAR ARRAY) :

   1. The position of next number is calculated by decrementing row number of previous number by 1, and incrementing
      the column number of previous number by 1. At any time, if the calculated row position becomes -1, it will wrap
      around to n-1. Similarly, if the calculated column position becomes n, it will wrap around to 0.

   2. If the magic square already contains a number at the calculated position, calculated column position will be
      decremented by 2, and calculated row position will be incremented by 1.

   3. If the calculated row position is -1 & calculated column position is n, the new position would be: (0, n-2).
